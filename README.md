This is the front-end portion of NoctJournal, a short-form journalling web app designed and built over the course of 9 days as a final project by a team of 3 students in the DecodeMTL Web Developer Bootcamp.

The front-end portion consists of a React app using 20~ components and an API wrapper which communicates with the back-end, currently deployed at https://glacial-dawn-27724.herokuapp.com/. 

Modules used in the front-end include [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom), [React Chart.js 2](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Superagent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent), [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) and [Google Map React](https://github.com/istarkov/google-map-react). 

CSS Grid and Styled Components were used extensively in the design of the user interface, as well as elements of Semantic UI.
